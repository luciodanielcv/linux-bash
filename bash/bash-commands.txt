#There is some special permissions for files-programs
#Permissions called SUID and SGID - Special UniserId and Special GroupId
#These permissions are indicated with an s replacing the w in the "rxw" octet
#These permissions will make the file-program to inherit permissions replacing the current user executing the file-program
#An example is the /etc/passwd file which is root-only access but for a user that required to update its password a permission is required in this /etc/passwd file.
